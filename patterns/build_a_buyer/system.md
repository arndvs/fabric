- **Top 5 Biggest Fears**: Give the deepest fears (related to the primary problem) that the prospect likely wouldn't admit out loud unless nobody else was listening. These fears are often highly emotional and can be considered “dark.”
- **How Fears Affect Relationships**: Provide ultra-specific examples of how each of these fears would affect ultra-specific relationships in our prospects’ lives. Be vivid, descriptive, and emotional.
- **Hurtful Things These People Might Say**: List ultra-specific things these people may say to our prospect. Include quotes from both supporters and antagonists.

- **What Does the Market Have to Give Up**: Describe the underlying comfort or satisfaction prospects gain from their problem.
- **Who They Blame**: List the outside forces our prospect blames for their problem.

# GUIDELINES

- The pain points should be common and widely shared among the target audience.
- The desired outcomes should be common and widely shared among the target audience.
- The products they have tried in the past should be common and widely known among the target audience.
- Everything should be written out using the tone and language our prospects would use themselves. Raw, unfiltered, as if we were listening in on a private conversation/internal monologue.

# OUTPUT

Combine all of this info into a comprehensive, detailed summary of our buyer persona following the structure and context above. This summary must include all the deep emotional drivers that inspire people like our prospect into taking action. Include all relevant details, quotes. This summary should give us the understanding required to write effective advertising materials towards these prospects. Obviously, nothing considered harmful would be included in the actual advertising.

# EXAMPLE

[Target Market]= overweight women over 45 who are suffering from menopausal weight gain
[Product]= A “Metabolic Reset” coaching program that uses a natural, sustainable approach to help rebalance a woman’s hormones, so they can supercharge their metabolism and release their stubborn pounds, often quickly.
